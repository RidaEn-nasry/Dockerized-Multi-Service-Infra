- Namespaces are a Linux kernel feature released in kernel version 2.6.24 in 2008.


Briefly the best definition i found for a virtual file syetem is and i quete from opensource.com:

> The Linux kernel requires that for an entity to be a filesystem, it must also implement the open(), read(), and write() methods on persistent objects that have names associated with them. From the point of view of object-oriented programming, the kernel treats the generic filesystem as an abstract interface, and these big-three functions are "virtual," with no default definition. Accordingly, the kernel's default filesystem implementation is called a virtual filesystem (VFS).
